Equalize Learning Opportunities.
==============

This is an e-Learning Community, which enables its members to learn from each other.

Generally, just like other social network platforms, this community highly depends on its members to contribute contents -- learning materials, methods, experiences, and comments. It is totally different from a traditional, centralized learning platform, where the study experiences are organized by people who runs the web site.

Due to variety of human intelligences, learning process is personalized, which renders standardized study approach less efficient. That is a rationale behind the idea of building a decentralized platform to provide diversified learning experiences.

The above proposition is based on a strong belief: the evolution of World Wide Web, especially web 2.0 concept, laid a foundation to equalize learning opportunities. Now, what e-learning can offer should be more than just convenience, efficiency, and low cost. With peer-assisted collaborative learning model, this community hope to facilitate people to learn from each other, regardless of their social, economical, academical or geographical status.


Also, this Community differentiates itself to other learning websites in several other ways:
- It's a free community, where people can study whatever subject without paying money for it.
- It's an open source project (applies LGPL 3.0 License).
- No ads or commercials in user interface.
