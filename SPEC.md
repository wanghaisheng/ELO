Functional Specifications
==============

The purpose of this document is to describe the expected functionality of the e-learning community. Comments are welcome and appreciated.

Generally, just like other social network platforms, this community highly depends on its members to contribute contents -- learning materials, methods, experiences, and comments. It is totally different from a traditional, centralized learning platform, where the study experiences are organized by people who runs the web site.

The above proposition is based on a strong belief: the evolution of World Wide Web, especially web 2.0 concept, provides a platform to equalize learning opportunities. Now, what e-learning can offer should be more than only convenience, efficiency, and low cost. With peer-assisted learning model, this community hope to facilitate people to learn from each other, regardless of their social, economical, academical or geographical status.

Therefore, the kernel of the app is a mechanism that encourages members to share their learning experience, methods and materials, so that people at all levels could benefit from the community. On the other hand, post owners could also learn from the feedback their followers give.

But how? Luckily, I don't have to reinvent the wheel, since there are inspiring models from great communities like GitHub or Stack Overflow, where members constantly contribute valuable ideas, answers and codes.
